Prediction
Barcelona in their current form is a team to fear, while Leganés is incapable of matching their champions, all that we can do is bet in favor of the visitors here. The attack of Barcelona along with a good defense makes them a strong favorite. But Leganés have proven they can bother the best, surprising them earlier this season.
EXPECTED SCORE: Leganés 1-3 Barcelona
Well this is a big match for both teams — Barcelona want to distance themselves from the rest of La Liga, while Leganés if they can help it they want to get out of the relegation zone. There's so much to play for in this fixture, which, as things stand, promises to be anything but dull...
